# Black-Scholes-equation

The Black Scholes equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the price evolution of a financial derivative over time. It is widely used to model options prices, and has become the standard benchmark for pricing options in the financial industry.

$$\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} - rV = 0$$

where:

$V$ is the price of the derivative
$t$ is the time to expiration
$S$ is the price of the underlying asset
$r$ is the risk-free interest rate
$\sigma$ is the volatility of the underlying asset
The Black Scholes equation can be used to price options on stocks, futures, and other financial instruments. It is based on the assumption that the underlying asset follows a geometric Brownian motion process, and that there are no dividends or other cash flows during the life of the option.

To solve the Black Scholes equation, we need to specify boundary conditions that describe the value of the derivative at expiration. For a call option, the boundary condition is given by:

$$V(S, T) = \max(0, S - K)$$

where $T$ is the expiration time and $K$ is the strike price of the option. For a put option, the boundary condition is:

$$V(S, T) = \max(0, K - S)$$

Once the boundary conditions are specified, we can use numerical techniques to solve the Black Scholes equation and determine the price of the option.
